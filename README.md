OpENer Electrical Energy Object
=========================

Welcome to OpENer Electrical Energy Object!

OpENer Electrical Energy Object is an extension object to [OpENer](https://github.com/EIPStackGroup/OpENer), providing an OpENer-compatible implementation of the Electrical Energy Object&trade;.
Currently it provides only a Electrical implementation of the Electrical Energy Object&trade;, but is open to further extension.
As [OpENer](https://github.com/EIPStackGroup/OpENer) it is licensed under the adapted BSD-style license (see [License](https://github.com/EIPStackGroup/OpENerElectricalEnergyObject/blob/master/license.txt)).

So you may ask "Why is this not directly part of [OpENer](https://github.com/EIPStackGroup/OpENer)?", and this is a valid question.
The answer to this is, that [OpENer](https://github.com/EIPStackGroup/OpENer) is focused on providing a near-to-minimal, but state of the art, implementation of a EtherNet/IP&trade; adapter device.
Nonetheless, we now and then develop additional objects for our usage, but cannot be strictly considered to be part of the [OpENer](https://github.com/EIPStackGroup/OpENer) project.
Hence, such objects are provided as separate project. Another benefit of this approach is, that [OpENer](https://github.com/EIPStackGroup/OpENer) does not get cluttered with a giant library (ok, not really giant, but you get the point) of object.

So, how do you use this? Again a good question! For some time already [OpENer](https://github.com/EIPStackGroup/OpENer) got a "drop-in" CMake-configure mechanism for additional object, when put into the *cip_objects* directory (you probably already asked yourself, whats this empty directory for?)

So the easiest way is to `git clone` this repository into the *cip_objects* directory and hit the `Configure` button in CMake, which should give you a checkbox for this object.
Now, that the object is included into the compile process, you have to use the following lines in cipcommon.c's CipStackInit() to actually use the Electrical Energy Object with [OpENer](https://github.com/EIPStackGroup/OpENer)

```
eip_status = CipElectricalEnergyInit();
OPENER_ASSERT(kEipStatusOk == eip_status)
```

also do not forget to add the header `#include "CIPElectricalEnergyObject/cipelectricalenergy.h"`

Contributing to OpENer Electrical Energy Object:
-----------------------
The easiest way is to fork the repository, then create a feature/bugfix branch.
After finishing your feature/bugfix create a pull request and explain your changes.
Also, please update and/or add doxygen comments to the provided code sections.
Please stick to the coding conventions, as defined in source/doc/coding_rules
The easiest way to conform to the indenting convertion is to set uncrustify as git filter in the OpENer repository, which can be done with the following to commands:

```
git config filter.uncrustify.clean "/path/to/uncrustify/uncrustify -c uncrustify.cfg --mtime --no-backup"

git config filter.uncrustify.smudge "cat"
```
